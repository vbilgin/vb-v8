- There is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average
- Human being to supply any given army on any given day

- And the best at murder are those who preach against it
- And the best at hate are those who preach love
- And the best at war finally are those who preach peace

- Those who preach god, need god
- Those who preach peace do not have peace
- Those who preach peace do not have love

- Beware the preachers
- Beware the knowers
- Beware those who are always reading books
- Beware those who either detest poverty
- Or are proud of it
- Beware those quick to praise
- For they need praise in return
- Beware those who are quick to censor
- They are afraid of what they do not know
- Beware those who seek constant crowds for
- They are nothing alone
- Beware the average man the average woman
- Beware their love, their love is average
- Seeks average

- But there is genius in their hatred
- There is enough genius in their hatred to kill you
- To kill anybody
- Not wanting solitude
- Not understanding solitude
- They will attempt to destroy anything
- That differs from their own
- Not being able to create art
- They will not understand art
- They will consider their failure as creators
- Only as a failure of the world
- Not being able to love fully
- They will believe your love incomplete
- And then they will hate you
- And their hatred will be perfect

- Like a shining diamond
- Like a knife
- Like a mountain
- Like a tiger
- Like hemlock

- Their finest art
