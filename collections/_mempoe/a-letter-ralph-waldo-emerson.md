- Dear brother, would you know the life,
- Please God, that I would lead?
- On the first wheels that quit this weary town
- Over yon western bridges I would ride
- And with a cheerful benison forsake
- Each street and spire and roof, incontinent.
- Then would I seek where God might guide my steps,
- Deep in a woodland tract, a sunny farm,
- Amid the mountain counties, Hants, Franklin, Berks,
- Where down the rock ravine a river roars,
- Even from a brook, and where old woods
- Not tamed and cleared cumber the ground
- With their centennial wrecks.
- Find me a slope where I can feel the sun
- And mark the rising of the early stars.
- There will I bring my books,--my household gods,
- The reliquaries of my dead saint, and dwell
- In the sweet odor of her memory.
- Then in the uncouth solitude unlock
- My stock of art, plant dials in the grass,
- Hang in the air a bright thermometer
- And aim a telescope at the inviolate sun.
