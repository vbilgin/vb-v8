I went into this book blind and against all odds, I was pleasantly surprised. It's a fun spiritual fable that doesn't take itself too seriously. That being said, I disagree with most of the fundamental ideas in this book. If you're a religious or spiritual person, I'm sure there's a lot you can take away from this quick read. Unfortunately, I'm not the least bit religious or spiritual so my only takeaways were some laughs and the joy of reading a well-written story. For the time commitment, not a bad deal.
