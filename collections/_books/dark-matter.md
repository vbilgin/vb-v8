A fun sci-fi thriller but I expected a bit more based on all of the hype I heard. The middle third of this book seemed to drag on for too long and the ending isn't very satisfying. I think this could've been a short story or novella without sacrificing the interesting multiverse aspects. Instead we get a full-length novel that doesn't really explore the most interesting ideas it presents.
