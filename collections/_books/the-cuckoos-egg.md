This book is a great example of truth being stranger than fiction. The twists and turns could be ripped straight from a 90s "hacker" movie and I wouldn't bat an eye. A superb read that kept me turning the pages and entralled throughout. We need more of these memoir-style non-fiction books that relate interesting experiences by people in industries that aren't often highlighted.
