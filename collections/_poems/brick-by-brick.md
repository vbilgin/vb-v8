- Brick by brick and stone by stone
- you've torn our home asunder.
- You've pulled the walls down,
- wrested plaster and plumbing,
- leaving rubble. Less than nothing.
- Below your watchful eye
- I fear there's nothing left to hide.
- Having stripped me bare, unearthed my lies,
- what is left now but my beating heart
- and you.
