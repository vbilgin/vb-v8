- Stones emerge from the shadow;
- they dot the land and shape the sight.
- I barrel forward, sharp-eyed,
- toward the thicket,
- down into depths known by others
- but not by me. Undeserving.
- Faced with pressure to pursue
- that fabled land, in charming blue,
- bleeding brown to crumbled grey.
- I know little of the land I seek
- though I seek little of it in the end.
- But now is only the beginning.
- I face the harsh night,
- And even harsher day.
- The Fight --
- And I seek it still. Such a fool am I --
- unburdened.
