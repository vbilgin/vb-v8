- Gazing at the luster of our sun,
- through tired eyes, a distant hum,
- I set my sights on distant lands,
- grasping at reluctant beauty
- with clammy, calloused hands.

- I will not quench my earthly thirst
- I will not cease my mighty stride
- I will not sleep for long at all
- ‘till I’ve wandered far and wide, 
- ‘till my weathered boots lack soles,
- ‘till I’ve swung our world to and fro,
- and seen all it has to hide.
