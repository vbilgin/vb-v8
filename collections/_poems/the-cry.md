- I whispered to the Beast:
- Begone!
- Drought stood at the ready.
- We swam on sand to flee.
- Roaming dogs could smell
- fear, or was it fight,
- that we had within us
- as we fled into the night.

- In darkness we sat,
- our numbers light.
- Cold, Queen of Ice, with us.

- She spoke:
- "Should it find you,
- scream my name
- and tell it this:
- O Beast! O tortured soul!
- You are free.
- Go as you please
- unto the world
- that bore you.
- I say it
- and it is so."
