This was a really fun read. Definitely get it as an audiobook if possible. The narration by Ray Porter was really something else; you could hear that he loved reading this and really took the time to understand the characters. Plus, all of his different accents were hilarious.

Like _The Martian_, this is a very fun hard sci-fi romp in space that I'd be very happy to see brought to the big screen. The pacing does have some issues after the half-way point but that's nowhere near enough to sour the book as a whole.

I suppose I’ll be giving _Artemis_ a shot next. It’s only about half as long so I assume pacing won’t be a problem.
