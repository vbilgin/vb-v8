The best thing I can say about this book is that it kept me interested all the way through. Other than that, the writing was sub-par and felt like it was in need of a more strict editor. Bilton clearly had opinions on the subject matter (all writers do, of course) but the majority of the book seemed to wade at the shallow end of criticality and understanding. Towards the end, you’re beaten over the head with the intertwining stories of Ulbricht going hiking while a teenager in Australia dies after taking a drug that was bought from Silk Road. That chapter in particular felt like lazy reporting and writing.

The book was nowhere near technical enough. I don’t mean that Bilton should’ve listed out the step-by-step process for starting a Silk Road copy but given how much of the story is predicated on things like the concept of a blockchain, Tor, and encryption, the descriptions of each of these things were lacking.

The story is of course engrossing. Ulbricht's story is one of the shining examples of truth being stranger than fiction.

Overall, if you’re interested in the events or like a good thriller, this book will be a great read for you. If you’re looking for a well-written and insightful look at Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road, keep in mind that you won’t find that here.
