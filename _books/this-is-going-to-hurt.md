This is probably the first book that made me cry laughing and actually gag. What a rollercoaster. One story ending with a laugh and another ending in unfiltered pain and sadness. If you want to go into the medical profession (especially as a doctor in the UK), read this book. I had thoughts of going into medicine as a physician assistant here in the US but I decided against it. This book confirms that decision. Medicine is an incredible field for so many reasons. You help people, having a real and supremely important impact on their lives and the lives of those around them. But I think it takes a special type of person to go into medicine. A person who can take the bad with the good. The responsibility you bear in the profession would be too much for me and I’m sure it would be too much for the majority of people. Hell, my heart was racing during parts of this book. That’s not someone you want as your doctor. Kudos to Kay for sticking it out as long as he did. If anyone can read this book and not understand why he left the NHS, you need to read it again.
