This is a really short book and it’s packed with great bits of information and advice. I started reading this because I had a business idea and want to validate it. That meant talking to potential customers and partners. If you’re in the same boat then I highly recommend this. Otherwise it’s short enough that it’s worth a quick read even if you aren’t in that position right now.
