- At times I sit and wonder
- what questions I would ask
- of Lady Fate or any god,
- if given such a chance.

- Yet if soothing answers were to drip,
- falling from sweetened lips,
- what should I embrace at the taste
- of their delicious nectar?

- For it dances in the veins,
- courting pieces of your whole,
- such that other thoughts are made meek
- and the mind is stifled, still and weak.
